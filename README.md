This uses speech to text system where you can give voice commands to ask questions to a chatbot
1)This project is created in flutter using dart language
2)This is based off of chat gpt based api
Another Future aspect is text to speech system :
This would enable people who cannot read or write to actually use a chatbot or even chatgpt where they can get access to the knowledge they need:
As of now its more of a convinience type of thing...maybe in future we could have a chat gpt based alexa or home assistant instead of the lesser accurate other versions
